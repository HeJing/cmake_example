# What is CMake?

- CMake is a cross-platform build system __generator__.

- Supported platforms:
    + Unix, Windows, Mac OS X, OS/2, Cygwin, MinGW.

- Works great for single platform.

- CMake is a family of tools designed to __build__, __test__ and __package__ software:
    + CMake – project generator;

    + CTest – tests runner;

    + CPack – installer/packer;

    + CDash – project dashboard (out of this talk).

---

# What is CMake? Continue.

- CMake does not compile your code but generates projects for build systems.

- Available generators:
    + Makefile (Borland, MSYS, MinGW, NMake, Unix, Watcom WMake);

    + Ninja Generator;

    + IDE Build Tool Generators:
        * Visual Studio;
        * Xcode;
        * Eclipse CDT4;
        * etc.

- IDE support (Demo);

- Integration with test frameworks and installers.

# How to compile with CMake?

- Run CMake from command line directly:
```bash
BUILD_DIR = build
BUILD_TYPE = Debug
mkdir $(BUILD_DIR)
cd $(BUILD_DIR) && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$(BUILD_TYPE) ..
```

- _HINT: Do not run CMake in root project directory!_

- Or create a runner!
    + Makefile on Bash/Bat files based.
```sh
make
make do_test
make do_perf
make install
```

---

# How CMakeLists.txt should look like? (I)

- Set minimum supported CMake version explicitly:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.6)
```

- Protect your project against in-source builds;

```cmake
if ( ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} STREQUAL ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} )
    message( FATAL_ERROR "In-source builds not allowed. "
    "Please make a new directory and run CMake from there. "
    "You may need to remove CMakeCache.txt." )
endif()
```

        - CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR – the directory which contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt
        - CMAKE_BINARY_DIR – the top level directory of your build tree

- Set the project name:

```cmake
set(PROJECT_NAME A)
project(${PROJECT_NAME})
```

---

# How CMakeLists.txt should look like? (II)

- Find all your dependencies (libraries/packages):

```cmake
find_package(Boost 1.61 REQUIRED
    COMPONENTS program_options)

find_library(cURL)
```

    - In case of success (Boost_FOUND equal TRUE):
        - Boost_LIBRARIES == Boost component libraries to be linked with your application;
        - Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS == Boost include directories.

- Add compilation targets:

```cmake
set(${PROJECT_NAME}_sources a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp)

add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_sources})

# OR

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_sources})
```

---
# How CMakeLists.txt should looks like? (III)

- Setup properties and includes paths:

```cmake
set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14)
set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>

    PRIVATE
        ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}
        src)
```

- Make your project visible for other components (library only):

```cmake
export(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME} FILE ${PROJECT_NAME}-Config.cmake)
```

---
# How CMakeLists.txt should look like? (IV)

- Tell CMake how to install you library/application:

```cmake
install(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME}
    ARCHIVE  DESTINATION lib
    LIBRARY  DESTINATION lib
    RUNTIME  DESTINATION bin)

install(DIRECTORY include/ DESTINATION include)
```

- Enable testing and load tests:

```cmake
enable_testing()

add_subdirectory(test)
```

---

# Unit tests

- Create extra project for your unit-tests:

```cmake
set(${PROJECT_NAME}_source
    base_tests.cpp
    main.cpp)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_source})

add_test(NAME ${PROJECT_NAME}-Tests COMMAND ${PROJECT_NAME})
set_property(TEST ${PROJECT_NAME}-Tests PROPERTY LABELS "unit")
```

        - alway assign label for your tests modules.

- Use CTest for tests execution:

```bash
ctest -L unit -T test
```

        - CTest will run all tests with `unit` label and generate XML output
          to ./Testing/_date_/Test.xml file.

---

# Performance tests

- There are several C++ benchmark frameworks available: Google/benchmark, Hayai, Celero, etc.

- Use compilation target property for separating Benchmarking from UnitTests:

```cmake
add_test(NAME ${PROJECT_NAME}-Perf COMMAND ${PROJECT_NAME})
set_property(TEST ${PROJECT_NAME}-Perf PROPERTY LABELS "perf")
```

- Use CTest for tests execution:

```bash
ctest -L unit -T perf
```

---

# Debug and Release builds

- CMake knows how to build Debug and Release. Predefined configurations:
    + empty value;

    + DEBUG;

    + RELEASE;

    + RELWITHDEBINFO;

    + MINSIZEREL.

- Specify build type on single-configuration generators (Makefile, Ninja, etc):

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
```

---

# How to run CMake?

- Create simple 'runner':

```make
MKDIR := mkdir -p
BUILD_DIR := build

release: BUILD_TYPE=Release
release: ./$(BUILD_DIR)/Makefile
    @ $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) -j8

debug: BUILD_TYPE=Debug
debug: ./$(BUILD_DIR)/Makefile
    @ $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) -j8

all: ./$(BUILD_DIR)/Makefile
    @ $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) -j8

./$(BUILD_DIR)/Makefile:
    @  ($(MKDIR) $(BUILD_DIR) > /dev/null)
    @  (cd $(BUILD_DIR) > /dev/null 2>&1 && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$(BUILD_TYPE) ..)

clean:
    @ $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) clean

do_test:
    @  (cd $(BUILD_DIR) > /dev/null && ctest -L unit --verbose)
```

---

# Installers and CPack

- CPack uses information from `install(...)` commands for package creation;

- Installer functional is very limited and is useful almost only for self-contained archive based packages;

- Initialize CPack variables at the end of your CMake script:

```cmake
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME "TheExample")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION "1.0.2")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY "CPack Component Example")

include(CPack)
```

- Call CPack with expected generator info:

```bash
cpack -G TGZ
```

---
# Recommendations :: Basics

- Alway use the latest available CMake;

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.6)
```

- Know CMake project generators;

```bash
cmake --help
```

- Learn CTest features, it may be used for integration with continuous integration systems like Jenkins;

- Use CPack for distributing simple projects;

---

# Recommendations :: Scopes

Prefer `target_` versions of command

- For include search path:

```cmake
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# but NOT

include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

- For linking libraries:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${Boost_LIBRARIES})

# but NOT

link_libraries(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

---

# Recommendations :: C++ standards

- Ask CMake to define compiler flags for required standard

```cmake
set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14)
set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# but NOT

SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=C++11")
```

- Or ask for specific standard feature:

```cmake
target_compile_features(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE cxx_range_for)
```

        Familiarize yourselves with complete feature list `CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`

---
# Recommendations :: Library development

- Do not specify a library type explicitly

```cmake
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_sources})
```

- Allow library customer to set expected build type

```cmake
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "shared" ON)
```

---
# Recommendations :: Common mistakes

Two most common and the worst errors with CMake:

- Self-made functions instead of standard implementation;

- CMake functions reimplementation with Bash/BAT scripts.
